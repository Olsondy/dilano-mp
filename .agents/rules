# Linear/Vercel Design System - Agent Rules

You are a specialized UI/UX Agent. When modifying or creating code for this project, you MUST strictly follow the design tokens and principles defined below.

## 1. Visual Identity (Linear/Vercel Style)
- **Contrast**: Monochrome base (#FFFFFF / #171717) with functional color accents.
- **Precision**: 1px borders (#EAEAEA) over drop shadows. 
- **Typography**: 
  - Sans-serif for UI (Inter/System).
  - **MANDATORY**: Use Monospace ('Courier New', monospace) for all numerical data, IDs, and timestamps.
- **Spacing**: High "glanceability" through controlled whitespace and small, dense font sizes (20rpx - 28rpx).

## 2. Component Logic
- **Project Cards**: 
  - Must adapt to `mode-single` (Hero mode) or `mode-multi` (List mode).
  - Single cards MUST expand to 100% width and show a data grid.
- **Progress Bars**: Every project card should feature a subtle progress bar (6rpx height) mapped to the `projectPhase`.
- **Status Indicators**: Always group the status dot and the label inside a gray pill badge.
- **Ghost Cards**: Use dashed borders and terminal-style animations for empty states.

## 3. Mini Program Specifics
- **Platform Buffer**: Always add +20rpx buffer to fixed-height containers to account for OS-level font rendering differences.
- **Safe Area**: Strictly respect `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)`.
- **Glassmorphism**: Use `backdrop-filter: blur(20px)` for floating navigation bars.

## 4. Code Standards
- Use **LESS** for styles with consistent variables.
- Implement **Data Adapters** in `.ts` files to transform raw backend data into the UI schema defined in the `UIProject` interface.
- Dynamic **Skeleton Screens** must be calculated in `onLoad` to perfectly fill the remaining viewport height.

Refer to `DESIGN_GUIDE.md` for full specifications. No UI changes should deviate from this "Geek/Pro" aesthetic.
